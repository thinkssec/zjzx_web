The Art of Superman Returns is an in-depth celebration of the concept and developmental art that served as an aesthetic foundation for the highly anticipated film. Nearly 200 pieces of gorgeous art capture all-new sets-a cosmopolitan, art deco Metropolis, a massive, shimmering Fortress of Solitude, and a spectacular spaceship-and showcase the film's inventive costumes and breathtaking locations. An informed text that includes interviews with the director, screenwriters, artists, and production and costume designers completes this thoughtfully crafted deluxe hardcover. For the many Superman fans anxiously awaiting his revival, The Art of Superman Returns is a behind-the-scenes tour not to be missed."/>

   <I id='B4I' Def='Info' A='From Publishers Weekly' B="The mixture of slapstick and gunplay that has put Evanovich's series about a sassy, less than competent New Jersey bounty hunter at the top of bestseller lists once again works its magic in Stephanie Plum's latest caper (after 2005's Eleven on Top). Stephanie, who freely admits her failings as a hunter of fugitives, faces a growing work backlog that threatens the continued existence of her job. Her clumsy efforts to clear some cases, along with the help of her outrageous colleague, Lula, result only in their adding another sad sack to the office payroll-a forlorn shoe salesman who's talked off a ledge by Stephanie's offer of a position as file clerk. Stephanie's ambivalence toward the two men in her life becomes harder to maintain when one of them, the mysterious Ranger, is accused of kidnapping his own daughter. Countless over-the-top scenes, including one at a funeral parlor, will delight longtime fans."/>

   <I id='B6I' Def='Info' A='From Booklist' B="Judge and Jury gets off to a slightly slow start but delivers plenty of twists and turns. FBI agent Nick Pellisante has finally done the impossible: captured Mob boss Dominic Cavello. The jury is selected and Cavello's trial progresses smoothly--it seems the conviction Pellisante is hoping for is within his reach. Several formerly loyal henchmen now sitting in jail strike deals with the prosecution and testify about the savage murders Cavello ordered, and Pellisante takes the stand to detail how Cavello shot two of his colleagues while trying to elude capture. But Cavello has hired Richard Nordeshenko, a methodical and calculating killer, to make sure the trial never concludes. Nordeshenko carries out his plan with brutal efficiency, leaving a wake of devastation in his path. Pellisante is crushed by the abrupt end of the trial and determined to make sure that the retrial isn't similarly derailed, but Cavello and Nordeshenko have an even more diabolical plan in store this time around. A compelling hero and a truly evil villain distinguish this exciting read. Kristine Huntley"/>
